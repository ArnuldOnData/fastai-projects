This contains "bear detection" model and the accompanying jupyter notebook. You need to have these packages instaleld for it to work:

fastai, pytorch, voila, ipywidgets

On Linux, You can use "pip" to install them. I always use "pip" with "--user" option in order to limit it to the user installations because it has a tendency to mess-up the system packages if used as root. For system wide installations using root, I recommend using your package manager.
