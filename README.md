# Projects found in Deep Learning for Coders by fast.ai 

These are the projects I have done while taking "Deep Learning for Coders" course at fast.ai. You can find these in the the book and also in videos available at:

You need to have these packages installed for it to work:  fastai, pytorch, voila, ipywidgets

On Linux, You can use "pip" to install them. I always use "pip" with "--user" option in order to limit it to the user installations because it has a tendency to mess-up the system packages if used as root. For system wide installations using root, I recommend using your package manager.


-- I stooped doing Deep Learning for now ---

Reason is the my interest in getting into industrial work, which is more about data cleaning, EDA, usability of  ML models, deployment, and produciton. If one can solve a problem using simpler models then it's better than using a complex and complicated models. These are the real problems that current industry is facing. Hence it's only one chapter from the deep learning book I worked on.
